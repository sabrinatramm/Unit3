 <p><em>Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace</em> (Decemnber 1815 - 27 November 1852), born Augusta Ada Byron and now commonly known 
  as Ada Lovelace, was an English mathematician and writer chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage’s early mechanical general-purpose, 
  computer, the Analytical Engine. Her notes on the engine include what is recognised as the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine. 
  Because of this, she is often described as the world’s <em> first computer programmer.</em></p>
  <p>Lovelace was born 10 December 1815 as the only child of the poet Lord Byron and his wife Anne Isabella Byron. All Byron’s other children were 
  born out of wedlock to other women. Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England forever four months later, eventually 
  dying of disease in the <em>Greek War of Independence</em> when Ada was eight years old. Ada’s mother remained bitter towards Lord Byron and promoted 
  Ada’s interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing what she saw as the insanity seen in her father, but Ada remained interested in him despite this (and was, upon her eventual death, buried next to him at her request).</p>
